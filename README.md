# GITT_plot
Plots GITT data and identifies peaks and valleys for overpotential estimation


This code produces 2 separate plots

plot 1: GITT
plots GITT raw data

plot 2: 3x1 plot which includes: 
subplot1: GITT raw data 
subplot2: GITT raw data with peak and valley markers
subplot3: Normalized overpotential as a functiton of specific capacity


testfile.txt is included

If you want to plot your own data, some modifications are needed (txtfile name, peak detection parameters, etc)
I have commented the code line by line so hopefully its clear what each line of code does.



First python script I've made- this was an activity to help me slowly make the matlab 2 python transition.

Enjoy!
